SceneKitDemo
============

This app is a demo of SceneKit for a presentation at Salt Lake CocoaHeads on March 5, 2013 by Andrew Madsen and Jake Gundersen. It provides a simple demo of loading a Collada model, displaying it, providing lighting for the scene, and rotating the model in space. Rotation can be controlled via accelerometer input from an external Bluetooth 4.0 board using code adapted from the [DKBLE112Demo](https://github.com/armadsen/DKBLE112Demo).
